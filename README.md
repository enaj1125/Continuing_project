## Code Summary
This package is developed by Yan Jiang in April, 2016. 
The code is to calculate the average degree of a vertex in a Twitter hashtag graph for the last 60 seconds, and update this each time a new tweet appears. You will thus be calculating the average degree over a 60-second sliding window.

## packages used
While you may use publicly available packages, 
modules, or libraries, you must document any dependencies in your accompanying README file.
